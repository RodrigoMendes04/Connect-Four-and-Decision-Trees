# ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence â€” Assignment 2024/2025  
**Adversarial Search Strategies (MCTS) and Decision Trees**  

---

## ðŸ“š **About the assignment**  
In this project, we implement:  
- A **Connect Four** game engine  
- Two adversarial search agents using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**  
- A **Decision Tree** (built using the ID3 algorithm) trained on:  
  - The classic **Iris dataset**  
  - A dataset generated by our MCTS agent for Connect Four  

We also provide testing examples, detailed explanations, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸŽ® **Connect Four**  
- Game modes:  
  âœ… Human vs Human  
  âœ… Human vs Computer (MCTS)  
  âœ… Computer vs Computer (MCTS vs Decision Tree)  

- Features:  
  - Visual board in text-based interface  
  - Turn indicator  
  - Intelligent computer moves using MCTS

## ðŸŒ² **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**  
- Implemented with **Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT)** as evaluation  
- Adjustable exploration parameters and number of simulations  
- Different strategies for child selection and exploration analysis  

---

## ðŸ§© **Decision Tree (ID3)**  
- Implementation from scratch (no scikit-learn)  
- Handles both:  
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Iris dataset** (with discretization of continuous features)  
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Connect Four dataset** (generated using MCTS results)  
- Supports classification of new examples  
- Results analyzed and presented in notebook format
